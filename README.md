[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EdurekaRPI/Edureka)

## **Project Overview**
Edureka is a university-wide dashboard designed to assist **President Schmidt‚Äôs Event Office** at RPI in advertising and creating campus events. The platform provides event planning tools, an integrated event calendar, and collaboration with other event planning applications such as **RPI Eventhub** and **Study Compass**. Our goal is to enhance event organization and increase campus engagement.
